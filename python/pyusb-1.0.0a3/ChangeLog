    Renamed libusb01 backend to libusb0.

Author: Wander Lairson Costa
    Renamed libusb10 backend to libusb1
    
    libusb 1.0 and libusbx probably will have backward compatibility across
    all 1.x version, so there is no point in calling the backend libusb10,
    since it should work with all 1.x series of the library.

    Limit zeroth string descriptor request to 254 bytes
    
    This string descriptor cannot be longer than 255 bytes anyway, since
    its length is defined by its first byte.
    
    Also, the libusb code warns "Some devices choke on size > 255".
    
    Since each language code is two byte long, only an even
    number of bytes makes sense, so request only 254 bytes.

    Makes legacy byteWrite() and interruptWrite() more compatible with pyusb 0.4.x
    
    PyUSB 0.4 has a very flexible input buffer treatment. This change does
    not mimic it for all, but make legacy module more close to it.

    Thanks Tormod Volden.

    Fix "localtion/location" typo.

    Limit get_string() length to string descriptor length
    
    Use the length as reported by the first byte of the descriptor.
    Otherwise (at least for some backend/kernel combinations) the buffer
    length provided by the user would be used instead, and NUL characters
    would be appended to the returned string.
    
    This also makes the legacy getString() function compatible with
    pyusb 0.4.

    Return deviceVersion and usbVersion as strings
    
    PyUSB 0.4 sets deviceVerion and usbVersion attributes as strings. So do
    it for the legacy module.
